## Introduction

### Overview
The RAG Chatbot for Tourism Recommendations is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to provide users with highlights and information about various travel destinations. The chatbot leverages the power of OpenAI embeddings to convert destination names and highlights into vectors, and Pinecone for efficient vector storage and similarity search. The interactive user interface is built using Streamlit, offering an easy and intuitive way for users to get travel recommendations.

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the use of RAG techniques in creating a chatbot that can effectively retrieve and generate relevant information for travel destinations. By integrating advanced AI models and robust storage solutions, this chatbot aims to provide accurate, relevant, and helpful recommendations to users planning their travels. The project also includes a comprehensive evaluation framework to assess and improve the performance of the chatbot, ensuring high-quality and reliable outputs.


## Features

### Retrieval and Display of Highlights
The RAG chatbot retrieves highlights for a given travel destination and displays them in an easy-to-read format. This allows users to quickly get key information about a location, including popular landmarks, attractions, and points of interest.

### Vector Storage and Similarity Search
The application utilizes Pinecone for vector storage and similarity search. By converting destination names and highlights into vectors using OpenAI embeddings, the chatbot can efficiently search for and retrieve relevant information based on user queries.

### Interactive User Interface
Built with Streamlit, the user interface is interactive and user-friendly. Users can simply enter a destination name into the input field, and the chatbot will provide the corresponding highlights. The interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for users to get the information they need quickly and efficiently.

### Setting Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your Pinecone and OpenAI API keys:
```
[
  {
    "destination_name": "Paris",
    "highlights": "Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral"
  },
  {
    "destination_name": "New York",
    "highlights": "Statue of Liberty, Central Park, Times Square"
  }

## Usage
### Running the Streamlit App
To run the Streamlit app, execute the following command:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### User Interaction
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8501. Enter a destination name in the input field to get the highlights information. The chatbot will display the highlights for the specified destination, providing you with key information and popular attractions.

For example, if you enter "Paris", the chatbot will retrieve and display highlights such as "Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral". This allows users to quickly access useful information about their travel destinations.

Example
Here is an example of how to use the chatbot:

Start the Streamlit app:

In the input field, type a destination name (e.g., "Paris").
The chatbot will display the highlights for the entered destination.


## Evaluation
## Evaluation

### Performance Metrics Calculation
To evaluate the performance of the RAG chatbot, several metrics are calculated for both the retrieval and generation components of the system.

#### Retrieval Metrics
1. **Context Precision**: Measures how accurately the retrieved context matches the user's query.
2. **Context Recall**: Evaluates the ability to retrieve all relevant contexts for the user's query.
3. **Context Relevance**: Assesses the relevance of the retrieved context to the user's query.
4. **Context Entity Recall**: Determines the ability to recall relevant entities within the context.
5. **Noise Robustness**: Tests the system's ability to handle noisy or irrelevant inputs.

#### Generation Metrics
1. **Faithfulness**: Measures the accuracy and reliability of the generated answers.
2. **Answer Relevance**: Evaluates the relevance of the generated answers to the user's query.
3. **Information Integration**: Assesses the ability to integrate and present information cohesively.
4. **Counterfactual Robustness**: Tests the robustness of the system against counterfactual or contradictory queries.
5. **Negative Rejection**: Measures the system's ability to reject and handle negative or inappropriate queries.
6. **Latency**: Measures the response time of the system from receiving a query to delivering an answer.

### Methodology
The following steps outline the methodology used to calculate the performance metrics:

1. **Define Test Cases**: Create a set of test queries and their expected outputs.
2. **Retrieve Data**: Use the chatbot to retrieve data for the test queries.
3. **Calculate Metrics**: Implement functions to calculate the metrics based on the retrieved and generated data.
4. **Analyze Results**: Compare the calculated metrics to the expected performance standards.

### Example Code
Here is an example of how to calculate some of the metrics:

```python
# Example function to calculate context precision and recall
def calculate_context_precision_recall(query, true_context, retrieved_contexts):
    true_positive = sum(1 for context in retrieved_contexts if context in true_context)
    precision = true_positive / len(retrieved_contexts) if retrieved_contexts else 0
    recall = true_positive / len(true_context) if true_context else 0
    return precision, recall

# Example usage
query = "Paris"
true_context = ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre Museum", "Notre-Dame Cathedral"]
retrieved_contexts = ["Eiffel Tower", "Louvre Museum"]

precision, recall = calculate_context_precision_recall(query, true_context, retrieved_contexts)
print(f"Context Precision: {precision}, Context Recall: {recall}")
```
